2.1.3
task 1
	Bluetooth has a range of at least 6 meters. 
	Bluetooth delay? Approximate by total delay measurements done and specifications.
	Delay is longer for full status requests, due to longer communication.

2.2.2
task 1
	
task 2
	Full nose dive still gives a correct measurement, measurements done at 30, 40, 50 and 100 cm, except at large distances: than the measured 
	distance becomes larger because the reflections are weak, not returning. This is however not really a problem, since braking at a larger 
	distance is never necessary. 
	A possible solution if it ever proves to be a problem is to ignore sensor measurements during hard braking.
	
task 3
	
task 4
	10000 delay measurements(sensor data) saved, mean 0.04-ish
	Save full status delay data?
task 5
	Compare distance measurements to previous measurements to find outliers, in that case take other sensor data as distance, 
	otherwise take mean of two sensors as distance. 
task 6
	Bluetooth operating frequency	2.4 Ghz
	Bluetooth operating range	> 6 meters
	Ultrasonic sensor resolution	1 cm, but depends on distance(closer is more reliable than further away, fe due to reflections)
	Ultrasonic sensor distance	Accurate up to about 250 cm
	Turning radius			76 cm
	Max. Command refresh time
